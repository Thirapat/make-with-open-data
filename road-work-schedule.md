## Problem statement
Knowing when and where construction is scheduled in SF is challenging. There is some data out there that covers this issue on the portal, but the reality is multiple agencies (internal and external) are involved in construction. There isn't, yet, a single source of truth for this data. But even without a single one, it's possible to dig in to data that does exist to demonstrate the possibilities.

## Challenge
Take a single dataset ([Envista Projects for Utility Excavation and Paving](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Envista-Projects-for-Utility-Excavation-and-Paving/sf93-6dmr)) and make the information in that dataset compelling. Help users understand, based on the dataset, when projects will be happening and where and for how long.

## Inspiration
* You don't have to replicate this exactly, but for inspiration see LA's streetwize: http://streetwize.lacity.org/ - this uses custom code based on one of Esri's app templates
